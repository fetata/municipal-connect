<h1>About Municipal Connect</h1>
    
<p>Municipal Connect is a simple platform created to bring people in the community closer together.</p>

<p>Sometimes small problems remain unsolved not because they are complicated, but because communication is missing. A broken streetlight, a damaged bench, someone looking for help, or someone willing to offer a skill — all of these need one thing: connection.</p>

<p>This platform is designed to make that connection easier.</p>

<p>Through Reports, citizens can signal local issues and help improve their neighborhood.<br>
Through Skills, people can offer their knowledge and support others.<br>
Through the Marketplace, community members can exchange items, post offers, or ask for what they need.</p>

<p>The goal is not just to build a website.<br>
The goal is to encourage cooperation, responsibility, and communication within the municipality.</p>

<p>A stronger community starts with better communication.<br>
Municipal Connect is a step in that direction.</p>
