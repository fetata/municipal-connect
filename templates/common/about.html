    <h1 class="mb-4">About Municipal Connect</h1>

    <p>Municipal Connect is a simple platform created to bring people in the community closer together.</p>

    <p>Sometimes small problems remain unsolved not because they are complicated, but because communication is missing. A broken streetlight, a damaged bench, someone looking for help, or someone willing to offer a skill - all of these need one thing: connection.</p>

    <p>This platform is designed to make that connection easier.</p>

    <p>Through Reports, citizens can signal local issues and help improve their neighborhood.<br>
    Through Skills, people can offer their knowledge and support others.<br>
    Through the Marketplace, community members can exchange items, post offers, or ask for what they need.</p>

    <p>The goal is not just to build a website.<br>
    The goal is to encourage cooperation, responsibility, and communication within the municipality.</p>

    <p class="mb-0">A stronger community starts with better communication.<br>
    Municipal Connect is a step in that direction.</p>
